//    total. A failed fetch or decode logs once and that key becomes a
//    permanent no-op for the session; the game keeps running silent.

  // --- THE LEAK LEDGER ----------------------------------------------------
  //
  // The desktop-Safari silence was closed as a leaked AudioContext: contexts
  // created per page load and never closed, accumulated by WebKit until it
  // stopped granting audio sessions to this ORIGIN. Quitting Safari cleared
  // it, and a reboot clears it too.
  //
  // That explanation fits every symptom, and it has never once been MEASURED.
  // It was inferred from a fix — which is exactly the shape of reasoning that
  // cost this project ten wrong attempts before it, and it leaves the next
  // recurrence starting from zero all over again.
  //
  // So: count. The tally survives reloads (it is the accumulation ACROSS
  // reloads that the theory is about, and a per-load counter would always
  // read 1). `created` goes up when a context is born, `closed` when its
  // close() actually resolves — not when it is requested, because a close
  // that never settles is precisely the failure being hunted.
  //
  // Read it off the console at the next silence:
  //   leaked climbing with reloads  -> the theory is right, and the release
  //                                    hook is not firing on this browser
  //   leaked at 0 or 1 while silent -> the theory is WRONG and two days of
  //                                    conclusions go with it
  //
  // Either answer is worth more than the guess, and neither costs anything.

  // Getting a context RUNNING is a state to maintain, not an event that

  // half only performs it.
  //
  // What went wrong before, in order, because each is a trap worth naming:
  //   - listeners in the BUBBLE phase sat behind every handler that calls
  //     stopImmediatePropagation, and a cinematic's skip handler ate the
  //     first keypress. Hence capture + passive, first in line, never
  //     interfering.
  //   - the listeners were removed SYNCHRONOUSLY, before resume() settled,
  //     so a single rejected attempt killed audio for the session. Now they
  //     stay until the context is genuinely running.
  //   - creating the context eagerly, outside a gesture, produced the state
  //     browsers are least willing to start. Eager creation is still right
  //     for DECODING, but if resuming keeps failing the context is rebuilt
  //     inside a gesture, which is the historically reliable path.

  // That distinction matters here: a context CREATED on pointerdown can run,
  // process, and feed an analyser real signal while Safari never grants the
  // page an audio session, so nothing reaches the speakers and the tab is
  // never registered as playing audio. That is exactly the operator's report,

  // YouTube. Resuming is permissive; CREATING is not, so only these may
