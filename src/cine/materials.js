// cine/materials.js — THE THREE.JS SIDE OF THE WEATHERED METAL.
//
// src/weathered.js bakes the maps as bytes and knows nothing about the GPU;
// this uploads them, and dresses a model IN PLACE by material name. The name
// contract is the one units.js already has: M_Armour / M_Turret / M_Detail /
// M_Steel / M_Track / M_Rubber are what the container, the crane, the portal
// ring and the MK-CX/2 all call their surfaces, so one walk dresses any of
// them and there is no per-asset copy of anything (plan §0).
//
// One bake per PRESET, not per material: three bakes at most, cached by
// their knobs. The ring's grey ladder — armour brightest, rubber darkest —
// is a per-name TINT multiplying the albedo map, which is what a
// material's colour is once a map is bound. Five bakes for five rungs would
// be five seconds and sixty megabytes for a distinction a multiplier makes.

// rubber 0x5e6469), re-based so the brightest rung is the map as baked.
