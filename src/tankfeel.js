// tankfeel.js — how a hover tank FEELS: the body lifting off its skirt, the
// idle vibration while the engine runs, and the rock as it sets back down.

// It lives in its own module because two places drive it: the game, and the
// unit viewer's test bench. Tuning it in the viewer and shipping something
// different in the game would defeat the point of the bench, so both call
// exactly this.
//
// No three.js import: it only writes to `.position` / `.rotation` on objects
// handed to it, so it is Node-testable against plain stand-ins.
