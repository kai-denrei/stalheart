// weathered.js — WEATHERED METAL FROM A SEED, AS BYTES.
//
// Dark gunmetal that has stood in a hostile alien atmosphere: a cool
// near-black plate, oxide creeping in patches, roughness low where the
// surface is protected and high where the wind has got at it, and a normal
// map of directional scratches over isotropic pitting.
//
// Pure: no three.js, no DOM, no canvas — three typed arrays out, Node-tested
// (test/weathered.mjs). The three.js side (DataTextures, the material, the
// apply-by-name walk) is src/fx/weathered-material.js. Same split as
// galaxyseed.js / galaxybake.js, and for the same reason: the numbers are
// testable and the upload is not.
//
// Why it ships in kilobytes: nothing is shipped. The maps are BAKED at load
// from a seed, so an authored CC0 PBR set's megabytes become ~250 lines of
// arithmetic, and "deterministic everything" holds — same seed, same metal,
// on any machine, in any run.
//
// THE ORM PACKING IS NOT A STYLE CHOICE. three.js reads roughnessMap from
// the GREEN channel, metalnessMap from BLUE and aoMap from RED (r160,
// roughnessmap_fragment / metalnessmap_fragment / aomap_fragment). A
// single-channel RedFormat texture samples as (r, 0, 0, 1), so the obvious
// "one small texture per map" would feed roughness and metalness a hard
// ZERO. Packing AO/rough/metal into one RGB texture is glTF's own
// convention, reads correctly in all three slots, and is one upload instead
// of three. The bytes are RGBA (alpha 255): three r160 has no RGBFormat for
// a DataTexture, so stride 4 is what the GPU takes and the baker says so
// rather than making the wrapper repack.

// and weathering has no use for simplex's isotropy. A vendored addon would
// also be a second RNG in a codebase whose whole determinism story is "one
// stream from one seed".
//
// TILEABLE BY CONSTRUCTION, and the periods are why. The lattice wraps at
// an integer period PER AXIS, so sampling x = u * px for u in [0, 1) makes
// the last column hash to the same lattice point as the first. Per-axis
// periods are what let scratches be anisotropic (px 96, py 6 = long thin
