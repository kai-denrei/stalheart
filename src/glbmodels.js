// glbmodels.js — shared machinery for authored models (.glb) used as game
// pieces. DOM-light; imported by towerlooks.js and units.js.
//
// Three problems every authored model hits here, all of them measured
// rather than assumed:
//
// 1. SCALE. Exported models carry whatever units the artist worked in.
//    Fitting matters in a specific way: these models are much WIDER than
//    they are tall, so fitting by footprint makes a squat smear and fitting
//    by height alone sprawls them over their neighbours. Fit by height,
//    capped by span.
// 2. VISIBILITY. A dark machine vanishes against a black board of neon
//    wire. The game colour goes on as EMISSIVE rather than replacing the
//    model's own materials.
// 3. DRAW CALLS. These models are ~60-110 separate meshes. Merging per
//    material cuts that by an order of magnitude — but merging destroys
//    articulation, so anything that must still MOVE has to be preserved.
